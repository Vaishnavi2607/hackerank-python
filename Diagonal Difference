Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is .

Function description

Complete the  function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Return

int: the absolute diagonal difference
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .
Each of the next  lines describes a row, , and consists of  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

answer:
def diagonalDifference(arr):
    # Write your code here
    s1 = 0
    s2 = 0
    for i in range(0,len(arr)):
        print(arr[i][i])
        s1+=arr[i][i]
    # print(c)
    for j in range(0,len(arr)):
        print(arr[j][len(arr)-1-j])
        s2+=arr[j][len(arr)-1-j]
    
    ans=abs(s2-s1)
    return ans
